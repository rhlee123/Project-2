# Project 2: Regularization Techniques
## Introduction
  In this project, I explored the use of five different regularization techniques: LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net, SCAD (Smoothly-Clipped Absolute Deviation), and Square Root Lasso. For 3 different datasets, I fit multivariate linear models using the aforementioned regularization techniques and compared the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of the predictions of these models to the MAE of a baseline multiple linear regression. Comparing the values of the loss function MAE between the different regularization methods and a baseline model allow the ability to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of certain regularization methods on a particular dataset. The regularized model that results in the lowest MAE would be the model that is most effective in minimizing error values. 
  
  The datasets explored in this project are: Boston Housing Price, Sale Price of Car, and a simulated dataset.
### Background 
  Regularization methods are used to determine the weights for features within a model, and depending on the regularization technique, features can be excluded altogether from the model by having a weight of 0. Further, regularization is the process of of regularizing 
  
  Regularization methods are especially useful in reducing the risk of overfitting.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rhlee123/Project-2/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
